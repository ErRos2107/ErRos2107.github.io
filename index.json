[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hi! My name is Eric Roseren, I am currently a Machine Learning researcher in the field of digital transformation for manufacturing companies also called Industry 4.0. I have an applied mathematics and statistics background and my expertise is in data analytics, statistical and machine learning modelling.\nI am a passionate Data Scientist and have been working in the data science field for the last 2 years. I hold a Machine Learning Researcher position at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) where I contribute to the digitalisation of various companies (mainly in the heavy metallurgic sector but also electricity network producers and insurance companies). I transitioned into data science from an applied mathematics and statistics background. What really excites me in this field is being able to leverage knowledge extracted from various sources of data and harness the latest state of the art algorithms to gain a more detailed understanding of a specific domain/application.\nAfter growing up in Luxembourg, I decided to pursue my higher education in the U.K to study mathematics at the University of Southampton. After obtaining my BSc in Mathematics I went to the University of Edinburgh to study Data Science and Statistics where I gained significant experience in statistical programming, especially in Bayesian computation. I worked on my end of year Consultancy project under the supervision of Dr. Vanda Inacio De Carvalho. The project consisted on investigating the risk factors that contribute to liver cancer in the Scottish population. I collaborated with the Edinburgh Hospital where I used their electronic healtcare data to develop a joint modelling framework (a combination of a Mixed Model and a Survival Model) using the Bayesian paradigm for parameters inference.\nSince June 2019 I joined LIST where my role is to support the digital transformation of Luxembourg industries.\nShould you need any additional information, feel free to contact by message on LinkedIn.\n  You can download my resum√© here\nAs an outdoor sport enthusiast, some of my free time is spent on exploring the Valais region on my bike, my skis or with my rope and my two feet!\n   Col de Momin - Winter 2021.

The most important risk factor for HCC diagnosis is cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis arises as a result of long-lasting damage cause to the liver due to the building up of scar tissue. Several factors have been identified of being the main cause behind cirrhosis, including viral hepatitis B and C (HepBand HepC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Longitudinal measurements of biomarker levels, age, gender, aetiologies and cancer status were obtained from patients undergoing screening from 2009 and 2017 in the South East region of Scotland. This report focused on analysing longitudinal healtcare data and describe several statistical methodologies to estimate the survival rate of patient affected by liver cancer.\nHere you can access the slides of the project presentation .\nSee my Github repository\n","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"b3b9ca9200be0977b427b78dd6d2d707","permalink":"https://erros2107.github.io/project/consultancy/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/consultancy/","section":"project","summary":"Data Science Consultancy Project undertaken at the University of Edinburgh.","tags":["Baysesian statistics","Healthcare"],"title":"Master Consultancy project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://erros2107.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
